# AI-Powered Quiz Question Rewriting Functionality

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of AI-powered quiz question rewriting functionality using Hugging Face transformers. This feature will enhance the quality and variety of quiz questions generated by the CanAnnounce application.

## Implementation Details
The functionality will leverage transformers from Hugging Face, specifically models fine-tuned for text generation and paraphrasing. 

1. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate transformer model such as `t5-base` or `bart-large-cnn`.
2. **Environment Setup**: 
   - Install the `transformers` library:
     ```bash
     pip install transformers
     ```

3. **Example Code**:
   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline

   # Load the model
   question_rewriter = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="t5-base")

   # Function to rewrite questions
   def rewrite_question(question):
       input_text = f"rewrite: {question}"
       rewritten = question_rewriter(input_text)
       return rewritten[0]['generated_text']

   # Example usage
   original_question = "What is the capital of France?"
   new_question = rewrite_question(original_question)
   print(new_question)  # Output: "Which city is the capital of France?"
   ```

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Diversity**: Automatically generates variations of quiz questions, making quizzes more challenging and engaging.
- **Time-Saving**: Reduces the manual effort required to create diverse quiz questions.
- **Improved Learning**: Helps users learn through varied phrasing and contexts.

## Integration Approach
- **Module Structure**: Create a new module within the CanAnnounce codebase dedicated to question rewriting.
- **API Integration**: Expose an API endpoint that receives a quiz question and returns the rewritten question.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests to ensure the quality and reliability of the rewriting functionality.
